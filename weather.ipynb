    "#### Task 1:  Create Directory Structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Using the command line, create a directory (that is, a folder) named data at the root of your repository. Inside data, create two subdirectories: timestamps and weather.</em>\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Steps Taken to Complete the Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logged into my GitHub account.\n",
    "2. Started Codespaces on GitHub.\n",
    "3. Created two directories within the data parent directory using the following commands:\n",
    "    - `mkdir -p data/weather`\n",
    "        (The -p flag ensures the data directory is created as a parent, with weather nested inside it).\n",
    "    - `mkdir data/timestamps`\n",
    "        (This command creates the timestamps directory within the data directory).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Commands Used to Complete the Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```mkdir```: it stands for \"make directory\" and helps the user organize files by creating folders/directories. The ```mkdir``` command can create multiple directories in the same time and also can set permissions to this directories. There are different options you can use with this command. For this task I used ```-p``` option to create the directory as a parent directory, meaning that the directory created can hold other directories inside. More options with examples in the following document: [```mkdir``` command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mkdir-command-in-linux-with-examples/). \n",

    "##### Notes on Completing the Task\n",
    "* I referred to the Week 5 video lessons by Ian McLoughlin to guide me through the process.\n",
    "* It made sure I was in the root of my account within Codespaces to create the directories in the correct location.\n",
    "* I practiced creating and deleting the directories multiple times to familiarize myself with saving changes to my GitHub account."
